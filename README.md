## Usage Tutorial
There's a nice guide from the original source of the layout available [here](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). This tutorial goes over the things that I changed for our lab. If I didn't touch it, you can assume I know nothing about it.

The page is powered by Jekyll.

To change basic 
1. Basic config options: _config.yml
2. Top navigation bar: _data/navigation.yml
3. Single pages: _pages/

All the pages currently used are in the _pages/ folder
1. about.md
2. research.html
3. publications.html
4. teaching.html
5. people.md

Folders for supporting files:
1. images/ - Image assets
2. files/ - Papers in PDF form can go here

## General Tips
1. Name a file “.md” to have it render in markdown, name it “.html” to render in HTML.
