    Ruixuan's work is about the investigation and analysis of systems with temporal logics. His work is carried out from the perspectives of system monitoring with temporal logics, temporal logic inference from data, and motion planning with temporal logics. His broader interests also include machine learning and autonomous driving.

    Neelanga is working on developing learning-based fast motion planning methods for dynamical systems like microbot swarms and collaborative teams of UAVs and UGVs. His work attempts to translate theories from optimal control, optimization and reinforcement learning to motion planning solutions. His research interests also include heuristic-based motion planning and transition systems.
