# About Me

A. Agung Julius is a Professor at the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering](http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/) at the [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://www.rpi.edu/). He is also a faculty member of the [Rensselaer Center for Automation Technologies and Systems](http://www.cats.rpi.edu/). His research interests lie in the intersection of systems and control theory, systems biology, and theoretical computer science. He received the Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from [Institut Teknologi Bandung](http://www.itb.ac.id/) (ITB) in Indonesia in 1998, and an MSc and Doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics from the [University of Twente](http://www.utwente.nl/) in the Netherlands, in 2001 and 2005, respectively. Prior to joining Rensselaer, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [GRASP Lab](http://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania.

Dr. Julius serves as an Associate Editor for the [IFAC Journal of Nonlinear Analysis: Hybrid Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/nonlinear-analysis-hybrid-systems) and the [IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8856). He is also an Associate Editor in the [IEEE Control Systems Society Conference Editorial Board](http://www.ieeecss.org/conferences/conference-editorial-board). Dr. Julius regularly serves in the program committee/editorial board of the Int. Conf. Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC), Workshop on  Hybrid Systems and Biology (HSB), IEEE Conf. Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), Indian Control Conference (ICC).

Dr. Julius co-authored papers that received the "Best Application Paper Award" at the 10th Int. Conf. on Ubiquitous Robots and Artificial Intelligence (URAI 2013), and a finalist for the "Best Paper Award" at the IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2013). At Rensselaer, he received the School of Engineering Award for Research Excellence (2016) and the James M. Tien'66 Early Career Award for Faculty (2017). Dr. Julius received an National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2010.
